This is a personal project I am working upon and very much a WIP. 
It is a health track app for personal use that I am developing to practice and improve my Python coding, learn about frontend GUI techniques via PyQt6 and also aim to add in AI support later to improve and apply those skills

Plan
Tab 1: Home page → App name & logo
Tab 2: Calorie Tracker → form to enter meals & calories
Tab 3: Exercise Tracker → log workouts & calories
Tab 4: Graphs/Progress → matplotlib charts inside PyQt to show data over time
Tab 5: Goals → record target weight and enter routine weigh-ins to measure long term progress
Tab 6: Meal Plan & Ideas → static list first, then AI alternative suggestions
Tab 7: (removed): Shopping List → add/remove grocery items
Tab 7: AI Chatbot → OpenAI chatbot for user to ask questions to and get useful information back
Tab 8: Settings → App specific settings for personalized preferances

core_todo_list = [ "AI suggested meal substitues", "desktop promts"]
extra_todo_list = ["calorie suggestions based on input factors", "goal advice", "sleep diary", "health by day trends", "AI driven improvements", "mobile support", "silent auto open app on bootup"]
completed_todo_list = ["Calorie tracker","exercise tracker", "app styling", "weight goal", "graphs of both over time period", "AI chat bot for health advice", "weekly weigh in reminders", "basic desktop notifcations""meal plan/ ideas",
"""
Tools used: Python, PyQt6, SQLite3, Matplotlib, OpenAI, Winotify
