This is a personal project I am working upon and very much a WIP. 
It is a health track app for personal use that I am developing to practice and improve my Python coding, learn about frontend GUI techniques via PyQt6 and also aim to add in AI support later to improve and apply those skills

core_todo_list = ["Calorie tracker", "exercise tracker", "graphs of both over time period", "weight goal", "meal plan/ ideas", "AI suggested meal substitues", "desktop promts/ reminders"]
extra_todo_list = ["exercise calorie calculator based on input factors", "goal advice", "sleep diary", "AI chat bot for health advice", "health by day trends", "AI driven improvements", "mobile support"]

Tools used: Python, PyQt6, SQLite3, Matplotlib, OpenAI
